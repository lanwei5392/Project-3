In this game, the enemies (the bugs) move horizontally. The player (the cat girl) needs to cross the road from the grass field to the river. The player should not bumps into any enemy.
The player is allowed to manually move to up, down, left and right to avoid bumping into the enemies and reaches to the river. Here is the DEMO URL http://lanwei5392.github.io/Project-3/


When playing this game locally, please open the index.js with Google chrome. The enemies (the bugs) will automatically move on the road. We need to use the "Up" key in the keyboard to move the player (the cat girl) from the grass field to the river to make the player win. 

If the player bumps into the enemies when crossing the road, the player fails. The game will start over. Please use the four Ariel keys "Left", "Right", "Up" and "Down" to avoid the player bumps into the enemies.
